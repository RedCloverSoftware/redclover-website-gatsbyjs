# Red Clover Software Website, GatsbyJS

This is the current public website for the business Red Clover Software Services Inc. Written in GatsbyJS (a React-based Static Site Generator Framework), you will need a NodeJS installation and Yarn in order to build this project. This project depends on a CMS for content - Prismic is our present CMS of choice.

This project is a demonstration of our React/JS capabilities - we are always learning and greatly appreciate any suggestions, insight, or issues to report!

Presently this code is NOT licensed for re-use (with the exception of GatsbyJS itself and any other 3rd party licensed code used in our work), we intend to contribute to the open source community with a more genericized Gatsby starter based on this project.


## Features

- The GatsbyJS Framework allows for static websites to be built with React code and using the massive react/gatsby ecosystem of libraries and prebuilt components. Regular React websites must be rendered by the users browser after being fully retrieved - a Gatsby site is built once during publishing, arriving in the users browser almost fully formed. This is far better for SEO and produces amazingly fast load times & interactivity.

- The Styled-Components library is used for the bulk of CSS. This library allows for separation of styles from code, as well as complimenting Gatsby's inline-style generator nicely.

- Prismic is our CMS of choice, integrated with the Gatsby plugin gatsby-source-prismic

- The Prettier library is used for code formatting.
